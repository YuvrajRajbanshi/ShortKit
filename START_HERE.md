## 🔄 HOW TO MANUALLY TRIGGER GLOBAL LOADER

If you want to manually show the global loader somewhere:

```jsx
import { useGlobalContext } from "../provider/GlobalProvider";

function MyComponent() {
  const { setGlobalLoading } = useGlobalContext();

  async function handleClick() {
    setGlobalLoading(true);
    try {
      // Your async code here
      await fetch("...");
    } finally {
      setGlobalLoading(false);
    }
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

### Change Colors:

Find these in component files and change:

- `green-500` → your color

### Change Animation Speed:

Find `2s` or `1.5s` and change to desired speed:
